# Rally Round the King

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Rally Round the King** (RRK) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) that aims to add a mechanism to preserve monarchs when countries convert from a monarchy to a republic. When a country changes directly from a monarchy to either a presidential, parliamentary, or council republic, an event fires, allowing you to pick whether to abolish the monarchy and send the king packing, or to keep the monarchy and keep them around as a figurehead.
