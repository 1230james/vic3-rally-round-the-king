# USAGE:
# Copy and paste this file into the common/scripted_triggers folder of any mod that has RRK interoperability.
# Uncomment the definition for RRK_is_active_trigger below.
#
# If RRK is inactive, that trigger definition should be the one used by your mod, but if RRK is active, it should be
# overwritten with the definition below, allowing you to tell when RRK is active or not dynamically.

# RRK_is_active_trigger = {
#     always = no
# }
